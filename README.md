# Employee Report Kata

## Description

The goal of this kata is to create a system that generates employee report based on certain conditions. The program should be able to handle employee data and produce a report according to the specified requirements.


### Employee Data Format

Each employee object contains the following attributes:

- **name** (String) – The name of the employee.
- **age** (String) – The age of the employee.



## Requirements

- As shop owner I want to view a list of all employees who are 18 years or older so that I know who is allowed to work on Sundays.
- As shop owner I want the list of employees to be sorted by their name, so I can find employees easier.
- As shop owner I want the list of employees to be capitalized, so I can read it better.
- As shop owner I want the employees to be sorted by their names descending instead of ascending.

**Important**
In this Kata all primitives should be wrapped.
